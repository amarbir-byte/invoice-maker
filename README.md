## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager
*   [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) for interacting with the Cloudflare platform.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/zenvoice-invoice-management.git
    cd zenvoice-invoice-management
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Bun for package management.
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

## üíª Development

To start the local development server, which includes both the Vite frontend and the Hono backend worker, run:

```sh
bun run dev
```

This command will:
*   Start the Vite development server for the React frontend, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.
*   Start the Wrangler development server for the Hono backend, typically on another port.
*   Vite is configured to proxy all API requests (`/api/*`) to the local Wrangler server, enabling seamless full-stack development.

## üì¶ Available Scripts

*   `bun run dev`: Starts the local development server.
*   `bun run build`: Builds the frontend application for production.
*   `bun run deploy`: Deploys the application to Cloudflare Workers.
*   `bun run lint`: Lints the codebase to check for errors.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is designed for deployment on the Cloudflare network.

1.  **Login to Wrangler:**
    Ensure you are logged into your Cloudflare account via the Wrangler CLI:
    ```sh
    wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Deploy the application:**
    Run the deploy script. This will build the application and deploy it to your Cloudflare account based on the `wrangler.jsonc` configuration.
    ```sh
    bun run deploy
    ```

Alternatively, you can deploy your own version of this project with a single click.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a modern, edge-native architecture:

*   **Frontend:** A React single-page application handles the user interface and client-side logic.
*   **Backend:** A lightweight Hono API runs on Cloudflare Workers, handling business logic and data access.
*   **Database:** A single Cloudflare Durable Object instance (`GlobalDurableObject`) acts as a multi-tenant storage solution, using an `IndexedEntity` pattern to manage different data models like users, clients, and invoices.
*   **Type Safety:** Shared types between the frontend and backend ensure end-to-end type safety.
